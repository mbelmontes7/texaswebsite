                                Founded in 1836, Houston was named after General Sam Houston, who guaranteed Texas
                                independence by winning the Battle of San Jacinto against Mexico. While Houston is known
                                for its energy industry, especially oil and natural gas.

                                areas. Houston's comprehensive layout is set apart by various communities and has a very
                                complex highway structure. The city could be more friendly and walkable in some parts,
                                but it needs some improvement in others. Houston is combined with its multiple food
