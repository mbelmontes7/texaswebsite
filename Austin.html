                </div>
                <p>Austin is filled with historical sites like the Texas State Capitol and has many trails and parks to
                    enjoy. What makes Austin unique is its mix of tradition and modern progress that the city is making.
                    Austin started as a small village called Waterloo in the 1830s and was later renamed to honor
                    Stephen F. Austin, an essential figure in Texas history. Today, Austin attracts creative people,
                    entrepreneurs, and tech lovers for job opportunities, as well as its lively culture and excellent
                    quality of life.</p>

                    Region and Classification
                </div>
                <p><strong>Austin is in the center of Texas, connecting the eastern and western parts of the state. It’s
                        a busy city with a mix of homes, businesses, and places to relax. Because of where it’s located,
                        Austin is an important cultural and economic spot in Texas. As the city grows, its urban
                        landscape is changing. Austin is known for its lively and welcoming vibe, its walkable downtown
                        and various food, music, and entertainment options.</p>

                <div class="av">
                    <h1>
                        Average Income and Economy
                    </h1>
                </div>


                <p><strong>Austin's average income reflects that it is a major tech center and one of the top places
                        to
                        live in the United States. In 2022, the median household income in Austin was around $110k.
                        Austin's economy is driven by a strong tech industry, with big companies like Apple, Dell,
                        and
                        IBM having large operations there. Besides technology, Austin's economy benefits from its
                        education sector, government jobs, and a booming entertainment and tourism industry. Despite
                        Austin's fast growth, Austin remains more affordable than other major tech cities, making it
                        appealing to professionals and families.
